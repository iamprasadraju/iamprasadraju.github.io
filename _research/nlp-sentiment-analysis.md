## Abstract

This research explores transformer-based architectures for sentiment analysis in social media text, with particular focus on fine-tuning strategies and model interpretability.

## Models Compared

- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach)
- DistilBERT for efficiency comparison

## Results

RoBERTa achieved the best performance with 89% accuracy on the test set.
