## Abstract

This research explores the application of deep learning techniques in medical image analysis, specifically focusing on automated detection and segmentation of abnormalities in radiological images.

## Methodology

We developed a novel CNN architecture that leverages transfer learning and attention mechanisms to improve diagnostic accuracy.

## Results

Our model achieved 94% accuracy on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods by 5%.
