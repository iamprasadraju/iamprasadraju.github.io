title: Music Genre Classification Using Convolution Neural Networks
summary: Music genre classification is the task of automatically identifying the genre of a song based on its audio features. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for this task because they can learn hierarchical features from spectrograms.

# Music Genre Classification Using CNN

An deep learning approach to automatically classify music genres from audio signals.

## Overview

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks to analyze spectrograms and classify music into different genres with high accuracy.

## How It Works

### 1. Audio Processing
Audio signals are converted into spectrograms - visual representations that CNNs can analyze effectively.

### 2. Feature Learning
The CNN automatically learns genre-specific features from the spectrograms without manual feature engineering.

### 3. Classification
The trained model can predict the genre of new audio inputs with high accuracy.

## Datasets

- GTZAN Genre Collection
- Free Music Archive (FMA)

## Results

The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets.
